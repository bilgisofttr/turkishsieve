**Last updated:** 2026-01-28 

This file presents the scoreboard of users who ran the application on their own machines and shared their results.  
**Thanks to all contributors!** 🙏

Rankings are sorted by **average time (seconds)** (lowest time at the top).

**Notes:**
- Count: Number of twin/cousin prime pairs found in the range (should be consistent across all valid runs for verification).
- Test Count: How many times the user repeated the same range (higher count = more reliable average).
- Average Time: Total runtime of all runs divided by Test Count.
- Ties in average time are broken by earliest submission timestamp.
