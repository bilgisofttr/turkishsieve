🚀 Turkish Sieve Engine (TSE) V.1.0.0Unique, Compact & Massive-Parallel Prime Discovery Engine📌 IntroductionTurkish Sieve Engine (TSE) is a revolutionary application that combines unprecedented computational efficiency, compact memory structures, and massive parallelization in prime number research. Based on the scientific methodology published on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18038661), TSE is a high-performance academic tool designed to detect twin primes, cousin primes, and prime gaps at massive scales ($10^{14}$ and beyond).📊 Key Metrics & AchievementsPeak Throughput: 339.4 Billion candidates/sec (measured on RTX 3070 @ $10^{12}$ range).Memory Efficiency: N/6 bit data structure (6x more compact than classical sieves).GPU Acceleration: Up to 11.0× speedup compared to multi-core CPUs in optimal ranges.Scientific Accuracy: 100% compliance with OEIS A007508 (Zero error margin for twin primes).💎 Why is TSE Unique?1. No Modular ArithmeticUnlike traditional sieving algorithms, TSE replaces expensive MOD/DIV operations with simple integer additions ($n \leftarrow n+p$). This hardware-friendly approach eliminates the heavy computational overhead of division in GPU/HPC architectures.2. Extreme Memory EfficiencyBy leveraging the mathematical structure of (p, p+2) and (p, p+4) pairs, the canonical N/3 bit sieve is reduced to an N/6 bit representation. This allows processing 100 trillion numbers ($10^{14}$) using only 1.1 GB of VRAM.3. Seamless Compactness & UI/UXNo Coding Required: A fully menu-driven, interactive interface for researchers.Smart Hardware Detection: Automatically analyzes system CPU and GPU specifications.Professional Reporting: Generates detailed performance metrics after every analysis.📝 Sample Performance Analysis ReportTSE generates detailed reports showing the architectural efficiency of the system:Plaintext==============================================================
