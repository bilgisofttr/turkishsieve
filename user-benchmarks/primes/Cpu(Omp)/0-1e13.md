**Last updated:** 2026-01-30 

This file presents the scoreboard of users who ran the application on their own machines and shared their results.  
**Thanks to all contributors!** 🙏

Rankings are sorted by **average time (seconds)** (lowest time at the top).

**Current World Leader (Fastest Verified):** 26,588,036,979 numbers checked per second – **@EBB_Server** (AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core Processor)

| 1    | EBB_Server      | serkancekic@msn.com | 2026-01-30 11:21 | AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core Processor | -               | 346,065,536,839 | 5               | 376.109         |

**Notes:**
- Count: Number of twin/cousin prime pairs found in the range (should be consistent across all valid runs for verification).
- Test Count: How many times the user repeated the same range (higher count = more reliable average).
- Average Time: Total runtime of all runs divided by Test Count.
- Ties in average time are broken by earliest submission timestamp.
